**The workshop on Computational methods for emerging problems in disinformation analysis DISA@ESORICS is organized during the [29th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) 2024]([https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/](https://esorics2024.org/)) in Bydgoszcz, Poland.**

**The session will be technically endorsement by [IEEE SMC TC on Big Data Computing](http://www.ieeesmc.org/technical-activities/cybernetics/big-data-computing) as well by [Lifelong Machine Learning on Data Stream](https://www.kssk.pwr.edu.pl/projects/lmlds) and [SWAROG](http://swarog-ai.pl/) projects.**

# About

Information analysis is nowadays crucial for societies, single citizens in their everyday life (e.g., while traveling, shopping, browsing, communication, etc.), as well for businesses and the overall economy. The right to be informed is one of the fundamental requirements for making the right decisions on a small and large scale (e.g., elections). However, information spreading can also be used for disinformation. The problem of fake news publication is not new, and it already has been reported in ancient ages, but it has started having a huge impact, especially on social media users or people watching media news (Internet, newspapers, TV, etc.). Such false information should be detected as soon as possible to avoid its negative influence on the readers and, in some cases, their decisions.

# Topics of interest

The main aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and scientists who are pioneering (dis-)information analysis methods to discuss problems and solutions in this area, identify new issues, and shape future research directions. 
We particulary invite works focuses on:

- computational methods for (dis-) information analysis, especially in heterogenous types of data (images, text, tweets etc.)
- detection of fake news detection in social media
- images and video manipulation recognition
- architectural frameworks and design for (dis-)information detection
- aspects of explainability of information analysis systems and methods (including explainability of ML)
- adversarial attacks on information analysis
- explainability of deep learning
- learning how to detect the fake news in the presence of concept drift
- learning how to detect the fake news with limited ground truth access and on the basis of limited data sets, including one-shot learning
- proposing how to compare and benchmark the fake news detectors
- case studies and real-world applications
- human rights, legal and societal aspects of (dis-)information detection, including data protection and GDPR in practice

# Paper submission

All papers should be submitted electronically via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=disaesorics2024).

<!--[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=dsaa2023).

The length of each paper submitted to the Research tracks should be no more than ten (10) pages and should be formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. For further information and instructions, see the [IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
-->

All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the conference’s topics of interest, originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.

Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have been issued as technical reports or similar cannot be considered for ECORICS’2024. 
<!--
An exception to this rule applies to arXiv papers that were published in arXiv at least a month prior to ECORICS’2024 submission deadline. Authors can submit these arXiv papers to ECORICS's024 provided that the submitted paper’s title and abstract are different from the one appearing in arXiv.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~


1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses


[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```



Colons can be used to align columns.


The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3



> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
